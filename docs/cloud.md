# Cloud Relay

The cloud relay lets remote attendees (parents, coaches, officials) follow the scoreboard from their phones over the internet, without adding load to the pool-deck Pi.

```text
Pi #1 ──── outbound WebSocket ────► Cloud VM (Docker + Caddy)
                                         │
                             HTTPS ◄─────┼───── attendees (phones, laptops)
                                         │
                                    /mobile  — scoreboard, results, schedule
                                    /admin   — key management
```

- Pi #1 opens a single outbound connection — works behind double-NAT with no port forwarding required.
- The cloud server re-emits events to all attendees; Pi #1 is unaffected by attendee load.
- Only scoreboard, results, and schedule data is exposed — meet files (`.lxf`, `.csv`) are never sent.
- Multiple organizers can share one cloud server simultaneously, each with their own revocable key.
- Caddy handles HTTPS and auto-renews Let's Encrypt certificates — no manual certificate management.

## Deploying the cloud server

**Requirements:**
- A Debian 12+ or Ubuntu 22+ VM (any cloud provider)
- Ports 80 and 443 open in the VM's firewall / security group
- A domain name with an `A` record pointing at the VM's public IP

SSH into the VM and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olivierouellet/Tremplin/master/install.sh -o install.sh && bash install.sh cloud
```

The script handles everything interactively:

- Installs Docker, fail2ban, and unattended security upgrades
- Clones the repo and generates a `SECRET_KEY`
- Prompts for admin username and password
- Prompts for your domain name and updates `Caddyfile`
- Generates a `DEPLOY_SECRET` and installs the deploy webhook as a systemd service
- Configures `ufw` (ports 22, 80, 443)
- Builds and starts the compose stack (app + Caddy)

When it finishes, open `https://yourdomain/admin` and add organizers.

## Managing organizers

The `/admin` page (HTTP basic auth with the credentials from `.env`) lets you:

- **Add an organizer** — enter an organization name; a cryptographically random 32-byte key is generated automatically.
- **Revoke a key** — the Pi with that key will be disconnected and refused on next connect.
- **Delete a key** — removes it from the list entirely.
- **View active meets** — shows every Pi currently connected with its meet name, location, sport, organizer, and connection time.

Share the generated key with the organizer. They paste it into their Pi's **Settings → Cloud** tab.

## Connecting a Pi to the cloud

In the admin UI on Pi #1 (`/settings` → **Cloud** tab):

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Server URL** | `https://yourdomain` |
| **Relay Key** | Key from `/admin` on the cloud server |
| **Location** | Venue or city (auto-filled from Lenex if blank) |
| **Sport** | Optional — shown on the meet picker (e.g. `Swimming`) |

Click **Save**. The Pi connects immediately and appears in the cloud's meet picker.

---

## How attendees connect

Attendees go to `https://yourdomain` on any phone or browser:

- If one meet is active, the scoreboard opens directly.
- If multiple meets are active, a picker shows each meet's name, location, and sport.

The scoreboard (`/mobile`) has three tabs — **Scoreboard**, **Results**, and **Schedule** — and uses the same theme and display settings as the organizer's Pi.

On iOS, tap **Share → Add to Home Screen** for a full-screen app-like experience (the prompt appears automatically on first visit).

## Updating the cloud server

Click **Update** in `/admin` — it pulls the latest code from GitHub and rebuilds the container automatically. The page polls until the server is back up, then reloads.

To update manually over SSH:

```bash
cd ~/Tremplin && git pull && cd cloud && docker compose up -d --build
```

Caddy and the `data` volume (which stores `keys.json`) are preserved across updates.

## Logs

```bash
cd ~/Tremplin/cloud && docker compose logs -f
```
