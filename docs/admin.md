## Pages

| URL | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Redirects to `/scoreboard` |
| `/scoreboard` | Full scoreboard (lane count from Meet Setup settings) |
| `/live` | Compact live view |
| `/mobile` | Mobile shell — three-tab view (Scoreboard, Results, Schedule) |
| `/results` | Results after each heat |
| `/schedule` | Meet schedule with start times and heat entry lists |
| `/settings` | Admin settings (login required) |
| `/info` | Hardware wiring and connection guide |

Append `?test` to any scoreboard URL to show mode control buttons (Splash, Intro, Running, Results, Next Heat) overlaid on the display — useful for testing without a live console.

## Meet-day workflow

1. In Splash Meet Manager: **File → Export → Lenex** → save as `.lxf`
2. Copy the `.lxf` file to Pi #1 at `~/Scoreboard/meet/`  
   (or upload it via **Settings → Meet Setup → Choose file**)
3. Click **Reload Names** — swimmer names and clubs are now live on the scoreboard

## Localisation

Built-in languages:

| File | Language |
| --- | --- |
| `locales/en.toml` | English |
| `locales/fr.toml` | Français |
| `locales/es.toml` | Español |

Each file defines short and long label variants:

```toml
[meta]
name = "English"

[labels]
event = { short = "EV",   long = "EVENT" }
heat  = { short = "HT",   long = "HEAT"  }
lane  = { short = "LN",   long = "LANE"  }
place = { short = "PL",   long = "PLACE" }
time  = { short = "TIME", long = "TIME"  }
name  = { short = "NAME", long = "NAME"  }
```

Add any `.toml` with the same structure to `locales/` (or upload via the Display tab) and it appears in the Language dropdown automatically. Files placed in `~/Scoreboard/locale/` take priority over the built-in ones.
