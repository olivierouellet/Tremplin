## Hardware Interface

| Parameter | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Interface | **RS-232** |
| Baud rate | **9 600** |
| Data bits | 8 |
| Parity | **Even** |
| Stop bits | 1 |

## Packet Structure

Every packet starts with a **channel byte** whose high bit (bit 7) is set.
Bit 7 being set is the packet boundary marker — the worker calls `is_packet_start`
on every incoming byte and flushes the current buffer when it sees a high-bit byte.

Maximum packet length: **9 bytes** (1 channel byte + up to 8 data bytes).

### Channel byte layout

```text
Bit 7:   1           (always set — marks packet start)
Bit 6:   running     (1 = lane is actively racing / time is running)
Bits 5–1: channel    (5-bit encoded address — see decode below)
Bit 0:   format      (1 = format-display variant — ignored by parser)
```

### Channel address decoding

```python
channel = ((byte & 0x3E) >> 1) ^ 0x1F
```

### Data bytes — nibble encoding

Each data byte encodes one display digit in its high nibble and carries
its own slot index in the high nibble:

```python
slot  = (byte >> 4) & 0x0F    # which digit slot (0–7)
value = byte & 0x0F            # raw nibble value
```

Converting a nibble to a display character:

```python
def hex_to_digit(c):
    c = (c & 0x0F) ^ 0x0F
    return ' ' if c > 9 else str(c)
```

### Time formatting (6 digits → string)

Digits at slots 2–7 encode a time in `MM:SS.HH` format:

```python
def format_time(a, b, c, d, e, f):   # slots 2,3,4,5,6,7
    m1, m2 = hex_to_digit(a), hex_to_digit(b)   # minutes
    s1, s2 = hex_to_digit(c), hex_to_digit(d)   # seconds
    h1, h2 = hex_to_digit(e), hex_to_digit(f)   # hundredths
    if s1 == s2 == h1 == h2 == ' ':
        return ''                                 # blank = no time
    ...
```

## Channel Reference Table

The console transmits packets whose first byte encodes the channel address.
Decoded channel = `((byte & 0x3E) >> 1) ^ 0x1F`.
Bit 6 of the first byte = running/finish flag. Bit 0 = format-display flag.

| Channel Name | CH (hex) | Decoded addr | Value (running) | Format (running) | HEX | Value (stopped) | Format (stopped) | HEX |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Lane 12 | 18 | 24 | 206 | 207 | CE | 142 | 143 | 8E |

The two columns labelled "running" carry bit 6 set (0x40); the two "stopped" columns have bit 6 clear.
The "Format" variant has bit 0 set (format-display flag) and is ignored by the parser.

## Notes on Unimplemented Channels

- **Home/Guest (0x0D, 0x13, 0x14, 0x15)** — team score segments used in certain swim meets.
- **Scroll (0x0F)** — drives a scrolling text segment on the physical board; no equivalent in the software scoreboard.
- **Lane 1 Mirror / Team Scores (0x11)** — mirrors lane 1 time and place during a race; reverts to team scores (0x0D) after reset.
- **TV / Broadcast (0x12)** — shows running time, lead split, and winning finish time only (does not cycle through all finishers). Intended for televised broadcasts; not needed for local display.
- **Time (0x16)** — separate time display segment. Displayed in the console.html header. Data format to be confirmed from observation.
